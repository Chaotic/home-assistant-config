# ChaoicUnreal's Home Assistant Config

This is the config for my active home assistant system.  This setup is heavily inspired by [Frenck's Home Assistant Config](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config).

I'm still in the process of setting everything up and moving off a smartthings hub (or getting the smartthings2mqtt bridge to work)
Everything is set up in its own file so that I can more easily add/remove components.

## Deployment

Copy the config files and recreate the secrets.yaml file Also you need the same hardware I have.
